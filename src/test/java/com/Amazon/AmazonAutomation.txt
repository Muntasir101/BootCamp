I Implement 3 different class for 3 feature.

1. LoginLogout: In this class i write 2 @Test methods. One is login and another() is logout().
               login() and logout() methods are independent. we can use those from anywhere.

2. Item Search: First we need to login(). Then we search item.
               Implement Data Driven approach. Get search keyword from Excel file.
               Verify this item. If passed write DONE in exel.
               Then logout().

3. Checkout:  First we need to login(). Go to cart. proceed to checkout. Then logout.

Every class I finished with logout. So that I can use all class for regression test and create very simple test suite.

I create Runner.xml for test suite. All class can run by this xml.
